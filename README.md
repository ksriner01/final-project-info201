# Project Brainstorm
## Authors: Sydney Wood, Roger Tram, Danhiel Vu, Kyle Riner

### Domain of Interest: eSports

Our domain of interest is the topic of competitive gaming, eSports. We are interested in exploring the innovative and integrative evolution and career viability of the topic. Ever since the University of Washington founded the UW eSports association at the beginning of 2020, we became engrossed in the idea of how eSports as a whole will affect the future of students, and if the career will be normalized in society.
